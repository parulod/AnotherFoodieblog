# AnotherFoodieblog
A blog about cuisines in general and from a stan point of a foodie.

I like to eat just as much as the next person, but also enjoy the experience that comes with it. I may not be a cook, but you do not need to be an executive chef to tell if a meal is delicious enough. Joy is a part of life, and for my fellow people who get a lot of it from food, let's traverse together through the delectible delights of this ever so fascinating menu of the world.

## Enjoy The Experience
Food is a luxury, and I am more than greatful to share my experience with it, with you. Food is like magic, it makes your sense tingle, and memories surface in seconds. While eating food, whether it be something like a comfort food, or something on the eccentric side that one may not be used to, it brings joy and disgust all at once. The experience of sitting down and feeling the homely aura ooze from that pot of nostaligic foods, is something I live for. The excitement of trying something new is so fun as new flavors and umami you never imagined enter you mind through the tastebuds. Go eat, another journey awaits.

## Get To Know Me Through My LOVE FOR FOOD
I am eater, always have been, always will be, just like you. I find comfort in food, and I want to share my experience with others. I could sit at eat while watching Tv or my favorite show on my computer for hours (with limitations and restrictions of course). When I sit down to eat, I feel calm and relaxed like their is nothing else that I should worry or stress about other than finishing this meal in front of me, which is to say, usually never to difficult. I am no chef, but I can cook like the average body. Does that make me less qualified? Well Professionally yes, but connectively, no. I purposely share my views as a noob on cooking and eating so that others can relate. Now, my foodies, let's eat!
