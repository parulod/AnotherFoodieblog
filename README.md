# AnotherFoodieblog
A blog about cuisines in general and from a stan point of a foodie.
<br>
I like to eat just as much as the next person, but also enjoy the experience that comes with it. I may not be a cook, but you do not need to be an executive chef to tell if a meal is delicious enough. Joy is a part of life, and for my fellow people who get a lot of it from food, let's traverse together through the delectible delights of this ever so fascinating menu of the world.
